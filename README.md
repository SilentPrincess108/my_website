My Personal Website!

I was inspired to make this website after seeing all the cool creations made on Neocities! Seeing how people expressed themselves on the web really inspired me to do the same, leading me to create this website!
I intend to use this site in much of the same way, a place where I can express myself and my love for my video games and programming! I also thought it'd make for a cool professional portfolio, but it's more nerdy than professional lol!

This is also the very first fleshed-out site I've made! I made it using just HTML and CSS! I am very much still a beginner in web dev, so my code isn't exactly perfect, but I learned quite alot while making this site, and it turned out close to what I imagined!
Although the site is complete structurally and stylistically, it's still lacking in content; however, I intend to finish that up as soon as I can!
